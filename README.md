# Climate-Change-Analysis-and-Forecasting

•	Performed analysis of the major factors(greenhouse emissions, fossil fuel and industrial, agriculture and forest burning) contributing to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, focussing on COP26 (United Nations Climate Change Conference)


•	Collected relevant data of 270 years and performed time-series prediction on significant contributing factors like emissions of carbon, dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 

•	Visualized how each factor contributed to change in the forest cover and the rise of surface temperatures across the world and performed statistical modelling and prediction for global surface temperature and sea-level rise using LSTM, ARIMA and SARIMA for the upcoming years.
